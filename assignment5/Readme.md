# By making use of RISCV Core: Verilog Netlist and Testbench, perform an experiment of Functional Simulation and observe the waveforms
### Steps to perform functional simulation of RISCV  
1. Create a new directory with your name ```mkdir <your_name>```
2. Create two files by using ```touch``` command as ```bibin_rv32i.v``` and ```bibin_rv32i_tb.v```  
 
3. To run and simulate the verilog code, enter the following command:  
	```
	$ iverilog -o bibin_rv32i bibin_rv32i.v bibin_rv32i_tb.v
	$ ./bibin_rv32i
	```
5. To see the simulation waveform in GTKWave, enter the following command:
	```
	$ gtkwave bibin_rv32i.vcd
	```


6. The GTKWave will be opened and following window will be appeared
